            <p class="description"><span class="moreInfo">Ardent London<span class="extraInfo">A candle and wax melt retailer</span></span> contracted me to design the front-end of their new e-commerce website on wix. This entailed pitching colour themes, motifs, and layout ideas until the employer was satisfied.
                After the design phase, I was required to implement the design through the wix interface. Other tech stacks were left unconsidered due to the employer wanting to use wix for it's user-friendly dashboard
                used to manage the inventory of products they sell. The video is from early in the design stage, as I am still waiting for a finished walkthrough for my portfolio.

            <p class="description">I developed this code using Java, this code proves the mathematical reasoning behind Efron's Dice.
                Efron's dice is an example of intransitive dice. In the example to the left, <span class="moreInfo">A > B > C > D<span class="extraInfo">In terms of rolling higher</span></span> more than 50% of the time.
                This would lead us to believe that A > D, however this is not true. TL;DR: there is always a die in the set that can roll higher than the die we roll.

            <p class="description">I developed this for a university assignment in my web design <span class="moreInfo">module<span class="extraInfo">CSY1018</span></span> in my Software Engnineering degree.
                I was required to produce the portfolio website that you are currently viewing to show my skills in HTML and CSS. The site itself needed to display past projects, a blog, and be mobile responsive.
